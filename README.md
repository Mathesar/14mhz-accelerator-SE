# 14mhz-accelerator-SE
Special Edition of the 14MHz accelerator without local fastram and support for DMA masters

This version was especially created for owners of SCSI sidecars like the A590. 
It should support the DMA transfers of these sidecars.
This version also does away with the local 14MHz FAST RAM to reduce cost. 
Finally, this version uses the DIP version 68000 so one can retry overclocking the original CPU to make the design even cheaper.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This design is UNTESTED AT THIS POINT. Use entirely at your own risk and have fun while doing so!
